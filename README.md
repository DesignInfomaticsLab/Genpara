## Introduction
🍳 GenPara is an interactive 3D design-editing system that fine-tunes an LLM using Gaussian-blob–based 3D shape parameters and infers each user's Region of Interest (ROI) via Bayesian inference.
> In 3D design, specifying design objectives and visualizing complex shapes through text alone proves to be a significant challenge. Although advancements in 3D GenAI have significantly enhanced part assembly and the creation of high-quality 3D designs, many systems still to dynamically generate and edit design elements based on the shape parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose GenPara, an interactive 3D design editing system that leverages text-conditional shape parameters of part-aware 3D designs and visualizes design space within the Exploration Map and Design Versioning Tree. Additionally, among the various shape parameters generated by LLM, the system extracts and provides design outcomes within the user’s regions of interest based on Bayesian inference. A user study (N = 16) revealed that GenPara enhanced the comprehension and management of designers with text-conditional shape parameters, streamlining design exploration and concretization. This improvement boosted efficiency and creativity of the 3D design process.

# 🎯 Text-guided latent editing & Generation with Fine-tuned Model

GenPara supports fine-tuning using extrinsic latent vectors generated by SALAD (https://github.com/KAIST-Visual-AI-Group/SALAD).
Please use ready-to-use data and pre-trained SALAD and SPAGHETTI checkpoints [[here]](https://github.com/KAIST-Visual-AI-Group/SALAD).

</div>

### 1. Prepare Extrinsic Latent Files
Each model should contain:
- 16 Gaussian blobs
- Each blob: 16 parameters (Mu, eigenvectors, Pi, eigenvalues)

Example JSON files in:
```
dataset/GenPara_finetuningDataset_chairs.jsonl/
```

### 2. Create Fine-tuning Dataset (JSONL)
Each record must contain:
- System instruction
- User request describing parts + adjectives
- Assistant output providing adjusted extrinsic latents
  
```
code/genpara_system_instruction.txt/
```

### 3. Fine-tune Model
Use OpenAI fine-tuning API:
```
openai api fine_tuning.jobs.create -t dataset/GenPara_finetuningDataset_chairs.jsonl -m gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
```

### 4. Deploy Fine-tuned Model
Model returns full extrinsic latent vectors suitable for reconstruction.
```
code/genpara_text_guided_chair_edit.py
```
